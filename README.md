# Cloudflight coding contest #38
Today I'll be participating at the Cloudflight Coding Contest. I participated in CCC #36 as well, placing #16 for #school globally and #193 for #classic. In both of those I was working in a group though, and today I'll be participating on my own in both #school and #classic.

### CCC
As you know, CCC is a global contest. At CCC #36 I was in the Netherlands and the contests were at very nice timestamps. Today though, I'll be participating from Japan and #school will be at 17:00 my time (which isn't that bad) but for #classic I have from 22:00 till 02:00. I'm planning on participating in both contests, but it'll mean that I can't do the #classic at the university I'm attending right now :(

^^ and I'll have to rush back home quickly lol
